## Usage
After setup is ready, using MiA SDK is easy. Initialize and present Mia SDK's checkout controller providing actions for success, cancelation and failure block parameters. The SDK will display a checkout WebView and invoke the action blocks accordingly. For full references, please refer to **Documentation** folder.

```swift
let miaCheckoutController = MiaSDK.checkoutControllerForPayment(
    withID: paymentID,
    paymentURL: paymentURL,
    isEasyHostedWithRedirectURL: easyHostedRedirectURL,
    success: { controller in /* handle success */ },
    cancellation: { controller in /* handle cancellation */ },
    failure: { controller, error in /* handle failure */ }
)

present(miaCheckoutController, animated: true)
```
